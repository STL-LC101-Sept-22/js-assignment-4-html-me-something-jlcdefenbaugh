            <p>ST. LOUIS, MO—Local shopper Bob Tate became a hero Saturday morning thanks to his sharp eye and keen insight.</p>
            <p>Tate, 26, said he’d just purchased some frozen dinners and was headed across the Target parking lot when he saw a pregnant woman with a large brood and felt compelled to openly question her understanding of contraception.</p>
            <p>“No truly informed person has that many kids,” Tate said. “Of course I asked her if she knew what caused ‘em. It’s what you do. You look out for your neighbor.”</p>
            <p>Witnesses said the mother appeared to cycle through feelings of confusion, shock, denial, and even fury, but eventually choked out thanks in between sobs of joy.</p>
            <p>It didn’t take long for a crowd to form.</p>

            <p>“We were all just so moved. I guess no one had ever bothered showing her that sort of kindness before,” said Vivian Kirk, who said she watched the entire exchange while her husband, Hank, unloaded their cart. “She insisted on giving him money, and then she went and asked him what he thought about the size of her body.”</p>
            <p>“I just love when people are willing to learn and grow,” Vivian added.</p>
            <p>“And grow she has,” Hank said. “Said she was only 22 weeks along. She got more than one cookin' in there or something?”</p>
            <p>Tate, who signed autographs well into the evening, said he never could have imagined the outpouring of love and appreciation that followed.</p>
            <p>“People were clapping and saying what a great service I’d done the community. They said they never heard such a question, either, and they couldn’t believe how clever I was,” he said.</p>
            <p>Tate, though, credits a higher power.</p>
            <p id="testP" class="funParagraph">“Applause comes and goes, but that $30 bought me two weeks of Salisbury steak,” he said. “You just never know how the Lord’s gonna bless you.”</p>
