            <p>ST. LOUIS, MO—Local man Bob Tate became a hero Saturday morning thanks to his sharp eye and keen insight.</p>
            <p>Tate, 63, said he’d just purchased some frozen dinners and was headed across the Target parking lot when he saw a pregnant woman with a large brood and felt compelled to openly question her understanding of contraception.</p>
            <p>“No truly informed person has that many kids,” Tate said. “Of course I asked her if she knew what caused ‘em. It’s what you do. You look out for your neighbor.”</p>
            <p>Witnesses said the mother appeared to cycle through feelings of confusion, shock, denial, and even fury, but eventually chocked out thanks in between sobs of joy.</p>
            <p>It didn’t take long for a crowd to form.</p>
